# Project Summary

This phishing simulation lab combines GoPhish and Evilginx to demonstrate the tactics and effectiveness of credential harvesting campaigns against simulated environments.

## Key Components

- **GoPhish**: Manages campaign creation, templating, and target group logic.
- **Evilginx**: Handles transparent proxying and session token interception.
- **AWS**: Hosted infrastructure for real-world simulation using EC2.

## Objectives

- Build phishing awareness.
- Observe MITRE ATT&CK-mapped behavior (T1566.002, T1556, T1078).
- Identify detection gaps and alerting logic for MFA bypass events.
